NORMALIZATION
Obtain a vector with a length of 1. This is useful for bouncings for example.

CROSS PRODUCT
Takes two vectors and returns a vector. It is used to get a normal vector to a plane. The normal vector is used a lot in graphics. 

EULER'S ANGLES
Expresses rotation as a combination of rotations around x,y,z axis.

QUATERNIONS
Construct that can describe complex rotations without incurring in gimbal locks.
The rotation is expressed in a different space. They can move between vectors or matrices easily.

MESH ANATOMY
Mesh: data structure to represent 3D geometrical information. Data needed: vertices, edges, faces. A face can have many edges. It is common to have quads but the GPU understands quads.

UV Coordinates: map 2D to a 3D surface
