Physics

1. Physics Simulation
	Physics concepts in games: 
	Speed (Scalar, length, duration, example: driving 50 km/h
	Velocity: v
	Acceleration
	Force: change v over time
	Impulse: change v instantly
	Drag
	Angular velocity
	Torque
	Mass

Usually physics simulation are done in a fixed timestamp, we use fixed timesteps
Types of physics body: static, dynamic, kinematic

1. Static: no movement under simulation, can be moved by user manually, has no velocity (like walls)
2. Fully simulated, mass = density * volume, move according to forces (balls)
3. Move according to velocity, does not respond to forces 

If an object is set to sleep the physics simulations are not performed on it

Physics need to receive data from the game engine but they also update them. Each collision fires some callbacks. 
The game can update itself but the physics engine always override it, this is not always the case, in Unity it's the opposite (the game has more priority)

while (gameLoop) {
	//do physics simulation
	//game logic update
	//rendering
	//wait for next frame
}
